## Welcome to My Raspberry Pi Ros Melodic Odyssey Pages

I built this humanoid robot and started coding movements then decided that I should build within a standard framework in case someone wants to pick up whereever I stop.  I learned that to buildMelodic for Ubunut 18.04 on the Pi, you must build from scratch.  I created a script that can be restarted at each of the steps in the instructions.  It's on the page named Melodic.  Feel free to copy and use this.  I started to upload my rosinstall.txt output file so you could see what you get and maybe provide some help on problems I am encountering?
